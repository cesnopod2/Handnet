Uploaded project contains proposed gesture recogniton module based on 
LSTM units. Implementation of the model contains in directory : 
[ add directory ]
Moreover I've proposed hand gesture recognition framework, which enables uploading
different recognition models to check how it behave in real-time situation.
It has dedicated GUI. Graphical user interface's code is also included in this repository. 
It was implemented using the Tkinter library.
